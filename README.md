“There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity.” - Nikola Tesla

The mission of the Tesla Dream program is to develop open source induction motor design and development tools. From initial sizing estimates to final FEM analysis utilizing electromagnetics.
